# GAN-boosted-Artificial-Neural-Networks
A vital component of this code is using a deep Artificial Neural Network (ANN) structure known as the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The GAN structure is combined with regressor (predictive) ANNs, to boost their performance when estimating the target parameter.
